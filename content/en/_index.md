I am currently Senior Data Scientist and Researcher at [MyDataModels](http://www.mydatamodels.com/), a startup that proposes a WebApp of Data Analytics for those who know little or nothing about Machine Learning. 
I am also a reviewer at the following machine learning international conferences: [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/) and [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/).

Before that, I was an R&D engineer at Engie Ineo for 4 years.
I also did a postdoc in Statistics and Image Processing sponsored by [CNES](http://www.cnes.fr/) and l'[INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/) with [Josiane Zerubia](https://team.inria.fr/ayin/josiane-zerubia/), 
as well as a 6-month postdoc in Statistics at the University of Tokyo (Japan) with [Yuzo Maruyama](https://yuzo-maruyama.github.io/). 
I obtained my PhD at Universit√© de Rouen (France), under the supervision of [St&eacute;phane Canu](http://asi.insa-rouen.fr/enseignants/~scanu/) and [Dominique Fourdrinier](http://www.litislab.eu/publicmemberbank/memberinfo_view?userId=dfourdrinier).

I studied the following problems and worked with the given methods: 
* **linear regression, classification and object detection** -- sparse optimization methods, both convex (Lasso-type) and nonconvex. 
* **non-linear regression** -- random forests, generalized additive models, symbolic regression. 
* **clustering** -- DBSCAN. 
* **model selection** -- Cp, AIC, BIC, loss estimators, etc. 

I applied those methods to the following areas: 
* **Environment** -- contamination of the atmosphere.
* **Biomedical** -- interactions the human brain's regions.
* **Earth observation** -- object detection on satellite images.
* **Defence** -- Recognition of radar and telecom signals.
