Our paper "Zoetrope Genetic programming" just got accepted to the [Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO)](https://gecco-2021.sigevo.org/HomePage).
It describes our symbolic regression algorithm, and applies it in regression.
You can already check it in the [Publications](/publications) section, or on [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.2765.pdf).
