Our paper "PaZoe: classifying time series with few labels" just got accepted to [EUSIPCO](https://eusipco2021.org/conference-programme/)! 
It combines PageRank semi-supervised learning for labelling with Zoetrope Genetic Programming for improving the classification and obtaining an interpretable model.
We applied it to time series for failure and gesture classification.
